# Diplomacy SearchBot

This code accompanies the paper ["Human-Level Performance in No-Press Diplomacy via Equilibrium Search"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0-uUGPbIjD).

A very brief orientation:
- The implementation for SearchBot lives [here](fairdiplomacy/agents/searchbot_agent.py)
- The supervised learning model architecture lives [here](fairdiplomacy/models/diplomacy_model/diplomacy_model.py), and the bulk of the training logic lives [here](fairdiplomacy/models/diplomacy_model/train_sl.py)
- The pretrained blueprint model is available for download under this repo's "Releases"
- The command to play one game with 1 SearchBot vs. 6 Blueprint bots is:

```
python run.py --adhoc --cfg c01_ag_cmp/cmp.prototxt \
    I.agent_one=agents/searchbot.prototxt \
    I.agent_six=agents/model_sampled \
    agent_one.model_path=/path/to/model \
    agent_six.model_path=/path/to/model
```

- The command to train a blueprint model on the webdiplomacy dataset is:

```
python run.py --adhoc --cfg conf/c02_sup_train/sl_20200901.prototxt data_cache=/path/to/data_cache.pt
```

Instructions to download the `data_cache.pt` object are in the [Dataset](#dataset) section below.

For more info about the configuration and command-line args, see the [Running Tasks](#running-tasks) section below.

## Game info
Diplomacy is a strategic board game set in 1914 Europe.
The board is divided into fifty-six land regions and nineteen sea regions.
Forty-two of the land regions are divided among the seven Great Powers of the game: Austria-Hungary, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey.
The remaining fourteen land regions are neutral at the start of the game.

Each power controls some regions and some units.
The number of the units controlled depends on the number of the controlled key regions called Supply Centers (SCs).
Simply put, more SCs means more units.
The goal of the game is to control more than half of all SCs by moving units into these regions and convincing other players to support you.

You can find the full rules [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Diplomacy/Rules).
To get the game's spirit, watch some [games with comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k04DTyEBeWw).
What's more, you can play the game online on [WebDiplomacy](https://webdiplomacy.net/) either against bots or humans.

After each pull it's recommended to run `make` to re-compile internal C++ and protobuf code. In case of missing dependencies, run `make deps` to install all dependencies.

### Running tasks

The code has a single entry point, `run.py`, that can be used to train a model, compare agents, profile them, etc.
We refer to this kind of activity as a task.
To specify which task to run and what parameters to use, we use configs.
Below an example of a config that is used to train an agent with imitation learning on human data:

```
train {
    dataset_params: {
        data_dir: "/path/to/games/"
        value_decay_alpha: 0.9;
    }
    batch_size: 2500;
    lr: 0.001;
    lr_decay: 0.99;
    clip_grad_norm: 0.5
    checkpoint: "./checkpoint.pth";
    lstm_dropout: 0.1;
    encoder_dropout: 0.2;
    num_encoder_blocks: 8;
}
```

We use text [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#simple) format to specify the configs.
Each task has a schema, a formal description of what parameters are allowed in each config, e.g., [here's the definition](conf/conf.proto#L119-L264) for the train task above.

Protobufs could be confusing, but good news - you don't have to understand them to run tasks.
Instead, you need to find the config for your task and run it.
We describe all tasks in the next section.
Here is an example of how to launch training on human data:

```
python run.py --adhoc --cfg conf/c02_sup_train/sl_20200901.prototxt
```

You can override any config parameter in command line using argparse-like syntax:

```
python run.py --adhoc --cfg conf/c02_sup_train/sl_20200901.prototxt batch_size=200 --dataset_params.value_decay_alpha=1.0
```

Note that it's optional to use "--" in front of overrides.

Check documentation for [HeyHi](heyhi/), the configuration library, for more details.


### Tasks overview

In general, all configs are stored in [conf/](conf/) folder and grouped by tasks.
You can find all possible arguments for all tasks in [conf/conf.proto](conf/conf.proto) file.
Below are the most important tasks:

 * Supervised training task. Configs in `c02_sup_train`, docs [here](docs/train_sup.md).
 * Making 2 agents play against each other for evaluation. Configs in `c01_ag_cmp`, docs [here](docs/compare_agents.md).
 * Training RL agent. Configs in `c04_exploit`, docs [here](docs/selfplay.md).

## Going deeper

We use an in-house fast C++ implementation of the diplomacy environment.
See [here](dipcc/README.md) for how to interact with it.

The games could be serialized as JSON files, e.g., our human data and test situations use this format.

Code structure:

 * [fairdiplomacy](fairdiplomacy/) - datasets, agents, and trainers
 * [conf](conf/) - all the configs for fairdiplomacy/ part.


External links:

 * ["No Press Diplomacy: Modeling Multi-Agent Gameplay" (Paquette et al, 2019)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8697-no-press-diplomacy-modeling-multi-agent-gameplay.pdf), on which our supervised learning is based.
 * ["Learning to Play No-Press Diplomacy with Best Response Policy Iteration" (Anthony et al, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04635.pdf). We use some model improvement from the paper.


### Pre-commit hooks

Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit hooks that will auto-format python code before commiting it.

Or you can do this manually. Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) auto-formatter to format all python code.
For protobufs use `clang-format-8 conf/*.proto -i`.
Circle CI tests check for that.

### Tests

To run tests locally run `make test`. Or you can wait Circle CI to run the test once you push your changes to any brunch.

We have 2 level of tests: fast, unit tests (run with `make test_fast`) and slow, integration tests (run with `make test_integration`).
The latter aim to use the same entry point as users do, i.e., `run.py`

There are some differences between running the tests locally vs on CI.

 1. Most integration tests use small fake data in the repo, but some use real data to check that the latest models are working.
Obviuously, these tests are skipped on CI and so local tests have better coverage.
  2. CI use CPUs for everything.

We use `nose` to discover tests.
It searches for `*test*.py` files and extracts all unittests from them. So usually your tests will be automatically included into CircleCI.

Some useful commands. Integration tests are notoriously slow and so sometimes one want to execute only one particular test. Here's how to do this. First, list all the test:

```
$ nosetests integration_tests/integration_test.py --collect-only -v --with-id
#2 integration_test.test_build_cache ... ok
#3 integration_test.test_rl_configs('exploit_06.prototxt', {}) ... ok
#3 integration_test.test_rl_configs('selfplay_01.prototxt', {}) ... ok
#4 integration_test.test_rl_configs_real_data('exploit_06.prototxt', {}) ... ok
#4 integration_test.test_rl_configs_real_data('selfplay_01.prototxt', {}) ... ok
#5 integration_test.test_train_configs('sl.prototxt', {}) ... ok
...
```

And then pass the id of the test to the nose:

```
nosetests integration_tests/integration_test.py  -v --with-id 3
```


### Dataset

The diplomacy model was trained via supervised learning on a dataset of 46,148 games provided by [webdiplomacy.net](https://webdiplomacy.net). 

The dataset can be downloaded from this repo's "Releases" page. The file has been compressed (via gzip) and encrypted (via gpg) with a password. To obtain the password, please email [admin@webdiplomacy.net](mailto:admin@webdiplomacy.net)

Once you have downloaded the `data_cache.pt.gz.gpg` file, you can run:

```
gpg data_cache.pt.gz.gpg
```

and enter the password to decrypt the file, and then:

```
gunzip data_cache.pt.gz
```

to uncompress the file. Then you can train a model by running the command in the [overview section of this README](#diplomacy-searchbot)

Note that re-training the blueprint model is not necessary to run an agent comparison -- a pre-trained model can be downloaded from this repo's "Releases" page.
